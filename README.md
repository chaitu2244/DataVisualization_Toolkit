This Python project provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing data using various techniques such as Pie Chart, Histogram, Heatmap, and Scatterplot. It utilizes the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and pandas for data manipulation. With this toolkit, users can easily upload their data files, select attributes of interest, and visualize their data in different ways.

Key Features:

1) File Selection: Users can select CSV files containing their data using a file dialog.
2) Attribute Selection: Users can specify two attributes from the selected data file to visualize relationships.
3) Visualization Options: Users can choose from multiple visualization techniques including Pie Chart, Histogram, Heatmap, and Scatterplot.
4) Interactive Interface: The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with and visualize their data effortlessly.

How to Use:

Click the "Start" button to begin.
Select a CSV file using the file dialog.
Enter the names of two attributes from the selected file.
Check the desired visualization techniques.
Click "Visualize Data" to generate the chosen visualizations.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
tkinter (for GUI)
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib (for plotting)
seaborn (for heatmap visualization)
